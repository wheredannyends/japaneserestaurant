          <h2>COMPANY HISTORY</h2>
          <p>
            DAQI Izakaya opened the doors to their first restaurant in the cold winter of 2006. As soon as people heard an authentic Japanese Izakaya was to be opened in Vancouver, local Japanese residents were quick to test out the establishment. With early support from Japanese patrons, Canadians were convinced that the shop was the best place to experience an authentic Japanese dining atmosphere. Over the next decade, DAQI grew faster than anyone had imagined, and the demand prompted the opening of three more locations in the downtown Vancouver area.
          </p>
          <h2>WHAT IS AN IZAKAYA?</h2>
          <p>
            Back in the Edo period (1600-1900), Sakaya (liquor shops) began serving alcohol and providing a place to stay and drink. There is another supposition that sobaya, buckwheat noodle shops, began serving alcohol with their food alongside otsumami. During this period, the number of single men was a lot higher than women, and izakaya became popular places and spread into society with casual dining spaces to share not only drinks and food, but also their life stories. In comparing an izakaya to a pub or bar, the food tends to be more substantial.

          <h2>ABOUT THE OWNER</h2>
          <p>
            Jin Shiojima is a man who has traveled from Japan to Canada on his own to make it in life. His homesickness was to the point where all he craved was Japanese food, and because of this, he was on a mission to find legitimate Japanese food. Everything he had found was, simply put, a disappointment, so to be able to cure himself of his homesickness, and to be able to make it in Canada, Shiojima-san opened up his own restaurant.
